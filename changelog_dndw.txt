Merged in invalidcharacter's GUI changes

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Original changes:

Added special text for Eve using AssFuck
Added trait AnalFanatic - boosts pleasure to both parties when having anal sex and makes the holder Frenzied for the duration (Surprise, Eve gets this)
Frenzied now boosts Power and Animism more than before, and reduces damage taken
Made the 'Mystery NPC' vastly more powerful to deal with the mod allowing higher damage and limits
Fixed the Experienced trait doing the opposite of what it's supposed to
Added '.ngs' extension to the autosave so the load dialog can see it straight away
Fixed a bug where Enthralling Trap could force a character to move back and forth if they can't fight their 'master' (thanks to ReliableNarrator)
Fixed a fatal bug for the Slime where it could destroy the wrong article of clothing
Various small fixes, mostly text related
CockGrowth now has an actual accuracy calculation instead of a flat 0
Escape is somewhat more likely to work in escaping stances
Added Imbue Fetish, which bestows a somewhat-random fetish on the target. Requires Fetish >= 10
Added Assjob - Descriptions written by CharredNewt
Added TailSuck and a status it can cause; Requires the EnergyDrain trait
Fixed LevelDrain giving the target Satiated instead of the user
Fixed EnthrallingTrap not having a string representation for use in the button (You can only see this under the influence of a Succubus Draft)
Generalized the structure for match modifiers (like underwear only, hypersensitivity cream, etc.) so they are easier to add. They can be created in JSON, too, though not with full functionality yet.
Completely remade the way NPCs handle enthralled opponents. It's now less powerful and more random.
Fixed stripping checks causing a crash if the character is naked.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Made Undress and Masturbate much less likely to be picked by the AI
(Probably) Fixed body modification skills causing changes in simulation. (Temporary changes were prevented, permanent ones weren't)
Added a duration to fetishes.
Finished Airi, who has been partially implemented for a long time. She's a slime, and will appear when you reach level 10.

Slime characteristics:
	Enhanced Slap - chance of knockdown.
	Enhanced Trip - higher success chance.
	Enhanced Dissolve - does not require items.
	Lower pain taken
	Can grow/remove genitals for a small amount of Mojo.
	Can use Spores, which force the opponent to use skills that can trigger counters
	Can use Engulf, which is a counter similar to Rosea's: it only hits on the turn after it is deployed.
		-It is a very, very bad idea to attack a slime the turn after they use Engulf
		-The Engulfed position dissolves all of the target's clothes and it's a fucking stance.
		-Aside from regular fucking skills, Multi Fuck allows the slime to use all genitals the two combatants have at once.
	Slimy Cock:
		-Can 'burn' through underwear, so you can use insertion skills while the opponent is wearing underwear.
		-Causes Horny when it is pulled out, due to some slime remaining inside.
	Gooey Pussy:
		-Weakly binds any cock inside of it. (Not as strong as vaginal tongue, for example)
		-Causes passive damage per turn. Like autonomous pussy, but not as powerful.
		-Causes greater Willpower loss if a cock cums inside of it.

Added a new match type, the FTC Match (Fuck the Carrier). It will trigger for the first time after reaching level 15, at then randomly (rarely) after that.
		
FTC Match:
-There are four hunters and one prey.
-The prey is naked and cannot have items.
-At the start of the match, the prey gets a Flag.
-The prey gets one point for every three turns they hold the Flag.
-If whoever is holding the Flag gets defeated, the winner takes the Flag.
-Each player has one base where they can resupply.
-The hunters can turn in the Flag at their base for five points.
-If the prey beats a hunter, they gain three points.
-Hunters get two points for beating other hunters, but no points for beating the prey.
-When a hunter turns in the Flag, the prey can collect a new one at their base.
-When the prey gets a new Flag, they cannot be attacked for a short time.
