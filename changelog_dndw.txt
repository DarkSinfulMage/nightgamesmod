Merged in invalidcharacter's GUI changes

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Original changes:
Added special text for Eve using AssFuck
Added trait AnalFanatic - boosts pleasure to both parties when having anal sex and makes the holder Frenzied for the duration (Surprise, Eve gets this)
Frenzied now boosts Power and Animism more than before, and reduces damage taken
Made the 'Mystery NPC' vastly more powerful to deal with the mod allowing higher damage and limits
Fixed the Experienced trait doing the opposite of what it's supposed to
Added '.ngs' extension to the autosave so the load dialog can see it straight away
Fixed a bug where Enthralling Trap could force a character to move back and forth if they can't fight their 'master' (thanks to ReliableNarrator)
Fixed a fatal bug for the Slime where it could destroy the wrong article of clothing
Various small fixes, mostly text related
CockGrowth now has an actual accuracy calculation instead of a flat 0
Escape is somewhat more likely to work in escaping stances
Added Imbue Fetish, which bestows a somewhat-random fetish on the target. Requires Fetish >= 10
Added Assjob - Descriptions written by CharredNewt
Added TailSuck and a status it can cause; Only usable by succubi (Reyka, or by using a draft)
Fixed LevelDrain giving the target Satiated instead of the user
Fixed EnthrallingTrap not having a string representation for use in the button (You can only see this under the influence of a Succubus Draft)
Generalized the structure for match modifiers (like underwear only, hypersensitivity cream, etc.) so they are easier to add. They can be created in JSON, too, though not with full functionality yet.
Completely remade the way NPCs handle enthralled opponents. It's now less powerful and more random.
Fixed stripping checks causing a crash if the character is naked.
(Probably) Fixed body modification skills causing changes in simulation. (Temporary changes were prevented, permanent ones weren't)
Added a duration to fetishes.
