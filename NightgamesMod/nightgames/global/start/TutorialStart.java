    /*
     * Tutorial: 
     * Girl npcs only, but should take player gender into account.
     * It begins much like The Silver Bard's, but continues on for longer
     * and has some variation.
     *  - General introduction: concepts, rules, etc. Explain win conditions,
     *    introduce main characters, pair up.
     *  - Player + Cassie, Mara + Jewel. Basic, skittish teasing. Tickle and the 
     *    like. Maya says it's pretty lame, but we should just build some 
     *    confidence (i.e. mojo) and then it'll be more fun. Mara and Jewel are
     *    a bit more adventureous, but not much.
     *  - Player + Jewel, Mara + Angel. Maya explains about stripping. Player
     *    goes for Jewel's jeans, but fails. Maya explains it's pretty difficult
     *    to strip bottoms of someone who is standing. Jewel launches a surprise attack
     *    and strips the player's shirt. Angel compliments him. Mara takes advantage of
     *    the distraction and strips Angel's shirt, revealing that she does not wear a bra.
     *  - Player + Mara, Cassie + Angel. Maya explains positions. Player gets a choice to
     *    wait and see or charge. Charge: get on top of Mara. Wait: Mara removes her bra,
     *    distracting the player, and then trips them. In either case, Mara feels between
     *    the player's legs. If they are male or female, they a compliment. If she's any
     *    of the 'special' genders, Mara makes a curious remark, which the rest hears.
     *  - Same pairs. Maya says how it's important to get out of submissive positions,
     *    because the one on top can do what they want. If the player is on top, he massages
     *    Mara's breasts and she ties his hands together and rolls over, just like in TSB's tutorial.
     *    If Mara is on top, she tickles and teases the player. When the player almost escapes,
     *    she ties them up.
     *  - Same pairs. Player has to struggle twice, Mara first removes their bottoms and then
     *    fondles the player. When the player breaks free, Maya ends the bout, but the player
     *    snags Mara's pants as she gets up.
     *  - Player + Angel, Jewel + Cassie. Status time. Maya says that combatants may find
     *    themselves affected by the fight in unusual ways, both good and bad. She whispers
     *    in Angel's ear. Then, Angel begins a strip tease, ending up naked. The player ends
     *    up Charmed, and this is explained.
     *  - Same pairs. Transformations! Maya explains that she has access to some rather
     *    exotic substances, and that the combatants might find a way to get them as
     *    well (Black Market). She hands the player a bottle, and tells him to get it
     *    onto Angel's breasts. She is, wisely, hesitant, but after a bit of wrestling
     *    the player succeeds. The bottle turns out to be a Bust Draft, and Angel's already
     *    consideranle breasts swell up even more, to her great enjoyment. Suddenly, Mara
     *    splashes something onto the player from behind. Turns out it's a Priapus Draft.
     *    If the player already had a dick, the girls voice their appreciation of the increased
     *    size. If not, everyone except Maya is amazed at the new appendage, and the player
     *    is rather nervous about it.
     *  - Player + Cassie, the others just watch. Maya suggests that we might as well put the new parts to good
     *    use. She has Cassie get naked, and the player charges her just as she finishes.
     *    They are a bit nervous and exchange a few kisses. Soon the player tries to fuck her,
     *    but finds that she is still a little dry due to the nerves. Maya says she really shouldn't
     *    have to explain this part, but that foreplay is important. The player proceeds to stimulate
     *    Cassie until she is sufficiently wet and then inserts. (Seperate flavor text if
     *    the player did not have a dick before.) It soon becomes clear that Cassie is much
     *    closer than the player is, and Maya says that whoever is on top and can control the
     *    pace hasa natural advantage. Not needing to be told twice, Cassie rolls the two of
     *    them over and starts riding the player with a vengance. They and up cumming pretty much
     *    simultaneously. Mara compliments them after a bit, saying that if they keep this up
     *    they'll be pros in no time. It's made clear that the other girls had been diddling
     *    themselves the whole time.
