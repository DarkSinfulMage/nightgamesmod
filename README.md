# nightgamesmod stable

My previous rewrite attempt in explicit-loops stalled, partly due to trying to keep up with features and systems added on other forks.

This stable branch is feature-frozen at v2.5.1.2 of nergantre's master branch. Commits to this branch will be either bugfixes or refactoring.

# Steps taken/planned

1. Some tests are failing or broken. Restore to green status.

2. Move game logic out of GUI. For this step, code reaching into the gui package is fine; code reaching out is not. Might look uglier than before.

3. ??? who am I kidding I don't have a plan we'll do it live
